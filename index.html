<p><h2>Facts about pigeon:<ul><li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals.</li><li> 
  They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.
  </li><li> They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs,
    and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li><li>
  Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. </li><li>
  They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</li><li>
   A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will 
   travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li><li>
  Pigeons are highly sociable animals and are often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li></ul></h2></p></div>

<p><h2>Facts about teddy bears:<ul><li>Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while 
  on a hunting trip in 1902.

  The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft
   plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.
  </li><li>
  The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.
  </li><li>

   African artist Cheryl Moss who is known for her minuscule work.
  </li><li>
  The world's largest stitched teddy bear is proudly American! The 55-foot-4 creation was made
   in 2008 and is named C.T.Dreams, which stands for Connect the Dreams. You can go visit it in

    <p><h2>Facts about cicada:
    <ul><li>  Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. ... </li><li>
The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. ... </li><li>

They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera).
